      "value": "<p>Monks of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.</p>\n<p>A kensei sees a weapon much in the same way a calligrapher or a painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.</p>\n<h3>Way of the Kensei Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.PI5BnTOWrGq8VrHq]{Path of the Kensei}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.mVE5uHZLr3cMyNvJ]{One with the Blade}</p>\n<p>11th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.8ZKMXWZrtvoyba2f]{Sharpen the Blade}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.EPfz6qDY9zR8Jd40]{Unerring Accuracy}</p>",
