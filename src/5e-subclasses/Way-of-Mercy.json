      "value": "<p>Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.</p>\n<p>Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order, administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities, while others might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.</p>\n<p>The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death.</p>\n<h3>Way of Mercy Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.CJPtR0Lj56izaztb]{Implements of Mercy}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.bd8Ia2hkt9D4zA21]{Hands of Healing}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Ne76OeZFtqXC67ed]{Hands of Harm}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.NYqFGEuTRReX8Ow6]{Physician's Touch}</p>\n<p>11th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.XINOp6bKkLhyiIyE]{Flurry of Healing and Harm}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.uTptpyEy6jY2yHMe]{Hand of Ultimate Mercy}</p>",
