      "value": "<p>Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art - the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: \"Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance.\"</p>\n<p>Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. And among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat-the greatest of dragons -as two of the song's first singers.</p>\n<h3>College of Creation Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Bl9OubeMoJMgmLsy]{Note of Potential}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.fvowDAZBEBQbxaHG]{Performance of Creation}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.L2NrgySJTyeobiVw]{Animating Performance}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Zq3W99SWwcBExLUy]{Creative Crescendo}</p>",
