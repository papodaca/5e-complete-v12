      "value": "<p>Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.</p>\n<p>Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.</p>\n<h3>Storm Sorcery Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.NGocKUuyxy7cqShm]{Wind Speaker}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.pRK3Bz4A4hc0dQMB]{Tempestuous Magic}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.739II8oO7loExLjS]{Heart of the Storm}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.IbVymIP0GlYxECll]{Storm Guide}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.EfJdCZH1KMZ7p6iZ]{Storm's Fury}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.Yc3gqidNg3WSk6bC]{Wind Soul}</p>",
