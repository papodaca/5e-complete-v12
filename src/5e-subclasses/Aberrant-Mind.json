You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?</p>\n<p>As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a possible origin of your power.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead style=\"text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5.36449%\">d6</td>\n<td style=\"width:94.6355%\">Origin</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5.36449%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:94.6355%\">You were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence.
