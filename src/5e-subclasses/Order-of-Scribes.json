      "value": "<p>Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.</p><p>Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!</p><h3>Order of Scribes Features</h3><p>2nd Level: @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.QQjetarrqYAUFGSH]{Wizardly Quill}, @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.2jHeIzhtZdDFes9d]{Awakened Spellbook}</p><p>6th Level: @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.4oFL6W26LpIQ0H1H]{Manifest Mind}</p><p>10th Level: @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.J06pQngQbcCvvbW9]{Master Scriviner}</p><p>14th Level: @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.cKBi83Vba4GBqtJI]{One with the Word}</p>",
