      "value": "<p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it.</p>\n<p>Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.</p>\n<h3>The Great Old One Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.xeOABOVB9ziUkBnr]{Awakened Mind}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.x4tD6NGqGzEoLyUe]{Entropic Ward}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.1br1c12EifrX8bJi]{Thought Shield}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.3VMsXC2tUN1tfilK]{Create Thrall}</p>",
