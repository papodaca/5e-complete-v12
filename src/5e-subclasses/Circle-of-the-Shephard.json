      "value": "<p>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey.</p>\n<p>Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Shephard Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.JJIZLKkXvH6TVZwz]{Speech of the Woods}, @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.TCUwnWjzLyvbGaIQ]{Spirit Totem}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.POrdHLcOOYHXsigs]{Mighty Summoner}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.yxgorOr6f5cbOgLY]{Guardian Spirit}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.OyaJlo8qZILYgVbq]{Faithful Summons}</p>",
