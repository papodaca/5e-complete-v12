Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Finesse. </strong>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy. </strong>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Light. </strong>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Loading. </strong>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>\n<p><strong>Range. </strong>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach. </strong>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Special. </strong>A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrown. </strong>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>\n<p><strong>Two-Handed. </strong>This weapon requires two hands to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Versatile. </strong>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Special Weapons. </strong>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p>\n<p><strong>Lance. </strong>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.</p>\n<p><strong>Net. </strong>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are form less, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>\n<p><strong>Silvered Weapons. </strong>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to non-magical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 Gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>\n<p> </p>"

It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military service.

        "content": "<p>Wealth appears in many forms in a D&amp;D world. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and properly can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.</p>\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\">Coinage</h3>\n<p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>\n<p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>\n<p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.<br />One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p>\n<p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>\n<p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p>\n<h4><strong>Standard Exchange Rates</strong></h4>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Coin</td>\n<td>cp</td>\n<td>sp</td>\n<td>ep</td>\n<td>gp</td>\n<td>pp</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper (cp)</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n<td>1/50</td>\n<td>1/100</td>\n<td>1/1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver (sp)</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/5</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n<td>1/100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electrum (ep)</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>1/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold (gp)</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum (pp)</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Selling Treasure</h3>\n<p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.</strong></em> As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Magic Items.</strong></em> Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't toa hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.</strong></em> These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trade Goods.</strong></em> On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.</p>"

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Variant: Equipment Sizes</strong></p>\n<p>In most campaigns, you can use and wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling's leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant's elegant robe.</p>\n<p>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise</p>\n<p>Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert. to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of D&amp;D.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Armor Proficiency.</strong></em> Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an armor. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong></em> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Heavy Armor.</strong></em> Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \"Str 13\" or \"Str 15\" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Stealth.</strong></em> If the Armor table shows \"Disadvantage\" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shields.</strong></em> A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. Vou can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>\n<h3>Light Armor</h3>\n<p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Padded.</strong></em> Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Leather.</strong></em> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Studded Leather.</strong></em> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>\n<h3>Medium Armor</h3>\n<p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hide.</strong></em> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chain Shirt.</strong></em> Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirl is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Scale Mail.</strong></em> This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish, The suit includes gauntlets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Breastplate.</strong></em> This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather, although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Half Plate.</strong></em> Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body, it does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p>\n<h3>Heavy Armor</h3>\n<p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p>\n<p>Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ring Mail.</strong></em> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings he1p reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and its usual1y worn only by those who can't afford better armor.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chain Mail.</strong></em> Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Splint.</strong></em> This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over c10th padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Plate.</strong></em> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>\n<h4><strong>Armor Table</strong></h4>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor</td>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td>Armor Class (AC)</td>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>Stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><em>Light Armor</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.pIoAasxSDREjlIeH]{Padded Armor}</td>\n<td>5 gp</td>\n<td>11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.uLEl8peGi41lV5YH]{Leather Armor}</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>11 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.SGZuZ3Vd2CzNb5Ig]{Studded Leather Armor}</td>\n<td>45 gp</td>\n<td>12 + Dex modifier</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><em>Medium Armor</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.FVWfkn58Q3qu5uyW]{Hide Armor}</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.R0B4rzNfkHG6mi5x]{Chain Shirt}</td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.YUNO7Mjx9RzORrf5]{Scale Mail}</td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.bllnsE4voooPaJ77]{Breastplate}</td>\n<td>400 gp</td>\n<td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.yiQNaAQ5yEDVtDcM]{Half Plate Armor}</td>\n<td>750 gp</td>\n<td>15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><em>Heavy Armor</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.eMFKsxUT7Z5r4FNg]{Ring Mail}</td>\n<td>30 gp</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.SnQfDljS7TU7n6Mh]{Chain Mail}</td>\n<td>75 gp</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Str 13</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.5dLfSMQLKr52dP8M]{Splint Armor}</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Str 15</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.0zqFgqWd4A3MdDqY]{Plate Armor}</td>\n<td>1,500 gp</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Str 15</td>\n<td>Disadvantage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><em>Shield</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-items.w9XbCvmgPpXFRrnp]{Shield}</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h3>\n<p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Don.</strong></em> This is the time it takes to put on armor.
