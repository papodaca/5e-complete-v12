        "content": "<p>This document is a homebrew ruleset for playing dragonchess in D&amp;D 5e. However, due to the complexity of \"true\" dragonchess, these rules play as if dragonchess was the same as a traditional game of chess.</p>\n<p>Characters with higher Intelligence have the most perks in this game, but someone with a swift hand could also be a difficult opponent...</p>\n<p>Until this is converted into a fully function module, this game can be tracked using <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vg6inL8vyCQG6DzaNUqhAa0htnmr0P0zJf3pP6HpKSo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Google Spreadsheet</a>. (Link opens a new tab; make a copy for your own use).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Both players start with 16 Dragonchess pieces: 8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 1 queen, and 1 king. Each Dragonchess piece has a numerical value attributed to it called a <strong>Piece Value</strong>, which will affect your rolls as detailed below. The combined total of your pieces is called your <strong>Total Piece Value</strong>, which should be recorded at all times. You begin with a Total Piece Value of <strong>28</strong>.</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Piece</td>\n<td>Value</td>\n<td>Count</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pawn</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Knight</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bishop</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rook</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Queen</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>King</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color:rgb(206, 212, 217)\">\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Total Piece Value</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">28</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Flip a coin to determine which player goes first and make a note that you're beginning on Round 1. Players take turns, each taking an Action (listed below) on their respective turns.</p>\n<p>Unlike combat in 5th edition, each turn during dragon chess consists of several minutes of both players moving pieces, with the Action being the end goal of that series of movements. Once both players have taken an Action, increase the Round number by one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Rules</h2>\n<p>To better simulate actual chess play—but moreso to keep the game fun and fair—the following rules are always in effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are proficient in dragonchess you can add your proficiency bonus to your rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rooks can’t be used until Round 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The queen can’t be used until Round 4.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can't attack a piece that’s not playable yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the beginning of Rounds 2, 4, 6, and 8, each player rolls [[/r 1d2]] and removes that number of their opponent's pawns from play.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of Round 15, whoever has the highest Total Piece Value wins. If values are tied the game ends in a stalemate.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Either player can forfeit or offer a stalemate at any point.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On a critical fail...</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When attempting to take a piece:</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The opponent has +1 on the next turn to try to take the piece that was used during your critical fail. This bonus can only be used on the turn directly after the critical failure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When attempting checkmate:</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The opponent has advantage on their next roll (regardless of the action being taken).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n<p>Below are the various actions you can take, such as attack, lay a trap, or even cheat! (We're watching you, rogues). Some actions have requirements that must be met in order to take that action, such as leveling up a pawn or attempting to checkmate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Attack</h3>\n<p><em>You attempt to remove an opponent’s piece from play. Select an opponent’s piece and one of your own pieces, the values of which are used in the calculations below.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Roll:</strong> Intelligence check + your Piece Value</p>\n<p><strong>DC:</strong> 14 + your opponent’s Piece Value</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Remove the opponent’s selected piece from play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Cheat</h3>\n<p><em>You attempt to retrieve a piece you’ve lost and place it back on the board.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>A lost piece</p>\n<p><strong>Roll:</strong> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</p>\n<p><strong>DC:</strong> Your opponent’s Passive Perception</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Retrieve a piece that you’ve lost to your opponent equal to or less than Value.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> Your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) Check - your opponent’s Passive Perception.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Attempts.</strong> You may try to cheat more than once, but eventually your opponent will catch on. Your DM may have your opponent switch to Wisdom (Perception) checks to catch you cheating, or have you roll a Charisma (Deception) contested by your opponent's Wisdim (Insight) check to gaslight your opponent into thinking you never lost that piece at all. The consequences for being caught cheating are up to the players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Checkmate</h3>\n<p><em>You attempt to corner the king and win the game.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Round 3+ and more than one knight or bishop, or one of any other piece.</p>\n<p><strong>Roll:</strong> Intelligence check</p>\n<p><strong>DC:</strong> 25 + (your opponent’s Piece Value - your Piece Value)/2 - Round number. The minimum DC is 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Congratulations, you win!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Lay a Trap</h3>\n<p><em>You attempt to lure an opponent’s piece into a trap by using one of your own pieces as bait. Pick a piece to use as a sacrifice, the value of which is used in the calculations below.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Roll:</strong> Charisma (Deception) Check + your Piece Value</p>\n<p><strong>DC:</strong> Your opponent’s Wisdom (Insight) check</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Remove your piece from play and one opponent piece equal to or less than Value.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> Your Deception Check + (Your Piece Value)*2 - Opponent’s Wisdom (Insight) Check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Level Up a Pawn</h3>\n<p><em>You attempt to get a pawn to the opponent’s side of the board to convert it to another piece.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Round 6+ and a pawn</p>\n<p><strong>Roll:</strong> Intelligence check</p>\n<p><strong>DC:</strong> 15 - (your Total Piece Value)/2 + your opponent’s Total Piece Value</p>\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> Convert one of your pawns into another piece of your choosing.</p>\n<p> </p>"
