While in this form, you have a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have <strong>disadvantage</strong> against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take [[/r 1d10]] force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.</p><p>You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a <strong>long rest</strong> or destroy one of your @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.rtfkCNJO1a5XECbe]{Soul Trinkets} as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.</p>",
