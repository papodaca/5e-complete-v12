Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h3>Roguish Archetypes</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.vBhI7eF9KRsQSROF]{Arcane Trickster}</p><p>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.wswAPRk7EXiX4Qdg]{Assassin}</p><p>You focus your training on the grim art of death. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.638nnizcGuYjKHMC]{Inquisitive}</p><p>As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.76Z3SkrOrtsvMYFt]{Mastermind}</p><p>Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.bxUmuzHWNKgjPhdz]{Phantom}</p><p>Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.WiORQZsIoINk3W3X]{Scout}</p><p>You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.1SwtwMKyIrkmyIrX]{Soulknife}</p><p>Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.lAWH9SUGytyYhk2j]{Swashbuckler}</p><p>You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-subclasses.mb3nDvoJ8X2IAknL]{Thief}</p><p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.</p>",
