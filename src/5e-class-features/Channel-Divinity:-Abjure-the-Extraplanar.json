As an action, you present your holy symbol and each <strong>aberration</strong>, <strong>celestial</strong>, <strong>elemental</strong>, <strong>fey</strong>, or <strong>fiend</strong> within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is <strong>turned</strong> for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can take the Dodge action.</p><section id=\"secret-INNFeTObkTHqiLJ8\" class=\"secret\"><p><em>Note: When you add this feature to your character, set Resource Consumption to Item Uses: Channel Divinity.</em></p></section>",
