While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be <strong>blinded </strong>until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains <strong>1d4 </strong>expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>DM Note: Give this feature to the wearer of this Infusion. Edit the Save DC to match the Artificer's Spell Save DC, and modify the chosen weapon to have the bonus to attack and damage rolls.</em></p>\n</section>",
