      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your <strong>concentration</strong> ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes [[/r 2d10]] force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong> or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.</p>",
