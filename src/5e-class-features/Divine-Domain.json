      "value": "<p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.idX3IP3WYFKhjm8g]{Channel Divinity} when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p><h3>Domain Spells</h3><p>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p><h3>Divine Domains</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.upJWPFJC7QQpYHgy]{Arcana Domain}</p><p>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.rYvOEy3WJpPdvUdt]{Death Domain}</p><p>The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.aDPStDNBLvUp8W5N]{Forge Domain}</p><p>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.ckghVR7S0EhTyVHj]{Grave Domain}</p><p>Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead’s rest, is an abomination.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.RZGyeeyaznmLJXAs]{Knowledge Domain}</p><p>The gods of knowledge – including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth – value learning and understanding above all.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.3ucpEtTDTg4E8gn0]{Life Domain}</p><p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.28UvGdhhxJPutf3q]{Light Domain}</p><p>Gods of light – including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty – promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.tlnlkOgavSJqn7En]{Nature Domain}</p><p>Many of the gods of nature have clerics, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.Ny9ITzPmUwwXqrJQ]{Order Domain}</p><p>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.MiAv28JTytJ4pQPg]{Peace Domain}</p><p>The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.5Gc8gyGOIasBh22M]{Tempest Domain}</p><p>Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.QkRtx7EgWbyG3EyP]{Trickery Domain}</p><p>Clerics of the gods of trickery are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.KcsRUkWICVDjar8G]{Twilight Domain}</p><p>The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.iLpwy0QY0SbxyloA]{War Domain}</p><p>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds.</p>",
