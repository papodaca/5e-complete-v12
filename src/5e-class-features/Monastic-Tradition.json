      "value": "<p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><h3>Monastic Traditions</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.ljG3tpaaTrlUSOh1]{Way of Mercy}</p><p>Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.u7mxegQz2zxGkoPy]{Way of the Ascendant Dragon}</p><p>The fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings.</p><hr /><p>@Item[wUqIcDpzM3z4f90Q]{Way of the Astral Self}</p><p>A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.g2EjU8qHjGqaH12A]{Way of the Drunken Master}</p><p>The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.KOniNmPgtkCYdIG9]{Way of the Four Elements}</p><p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will.</p><hr /><p>@Item[GPfbLxG9flGMtGR8]{Way of the Kensei}</p><p>Monks of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body.</p><hr /><p>@Item[Fo1fpknkw4w9SaMO]{Way of the Long Death}</p><p>Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.3JvVEcKHICexo6Yi]{Way of the Open Hand}</p><p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.TUGZdx62zgWzuwAa]{Way of Shadow}</p><p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.gXaSQa5Z0K5y7Zmp]{Way of the Sun Soul}</p><p>Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light.</p>",
