The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.</p></li><li><p>When you cast a wizard spell as a <strong>ritual</strong>, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul><p>If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.QQjetarrqYAUFGSH]{Wizardly Quill} to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.</p>",
