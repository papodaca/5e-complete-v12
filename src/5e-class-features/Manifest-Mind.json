      "value": "<p>At 6th level, you can conjure forth the mind of your @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.2jHeIzhtZdDFes9d]{Awakened Spellbook}. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).</p><p>While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has <strong>darkvision</strong> with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).</p><p>Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <strong>long rest</strong>.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.</p><p>The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong>, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.</p><section id=\"secret-mE5WdVL6J1mM66lG\" class=\"secret\"><p><em>Note: This feature has two different things that need to be tracked. It's recommended to use this feature's Limited Uses to 1 per Long Rest to track how many times you conjure the mind.</em></p><p><em>To track how many times you've cast a spell in the mind's location, create a Resource on your character's Attributes page, then set this feature's Resource Consumption to Item Uses: resources.primary.value. (Or secondary, if that's the Resource slot you choose).</em></p></section>",
