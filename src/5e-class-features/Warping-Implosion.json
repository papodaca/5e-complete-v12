      "value": "<p>At 18th level, You can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can <strong>teleport </strong>to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong>. On a failed save, a creature takes <strong>3d10 force damage</strong> and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong>, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>",
