      "value": "<p>By 3rd level, your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>\n<details>\n<summary style=\"padding-bottom:8px\"><strong>Full Description</strong></summary>\n<blockquote style=\"font-style:normal\">\n<p>In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the <strong>Dodge </strong>action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are <strong>incapacitated</strong>, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>If the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.WLS2Jd3xIS8rqqHy]{Mending} spell is cast on it, it regains <strong>2d6 hit points</strong>. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.O1YQD4dGJgYz8PWD]{Smith's Tools} as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a <strong>spell slot of 1st level or higher</strong>. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.</p>\n<p>At the end of a <strong>long rest</strong>, you can create a new steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details><details>\n<summary style=\"padding-bottom:8px\"><strong>Steel Defender</strong></summary>\n<blockquote style=\"font-style:normal\">\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Steel Defender</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Medium construct</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 15 (natural armor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 2 + your Intelligence modifier + 5 times your artificer level (the defender has a number of Hit Dice [d8s] equal to your artificer level)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>WIS</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>12 (+1)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>4 (-3)</td>\n<td>10 (+0)</td>\n<td>6 (-2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dex +1 plus PB, Con +2 plus PB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics +2 plus PB, Perception +0 plus PB x 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> charmed, exhaustion, poisoned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 + (PB x 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Languages:</strong> understands the languages you speak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Challenge:</strong> —</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus (PB):</strong> equals your bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><em><strong>Vigilant.</strong></em> The defender can't be surprised.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Actions</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em><strong>Force-Empowered Rend.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. <em>Hit:</em> 1d8 + PB force damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em><strong>Repair (3/Day).</strong></em> The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore 2d8 + PB hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Reactions</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em><strong>Deflect Attack.</strong></em> The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: Use the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-creatures.F60iHdiiV1CfYdLU]{Steel Defender} stat block and update its health and bonuses.</em></p>\n</section>",
