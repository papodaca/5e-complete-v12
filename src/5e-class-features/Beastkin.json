      "value": "<p>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of hunter lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.</p>\n<p>You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.</p>\n<p>You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles) from you.</p>\n<p>If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</p>",
