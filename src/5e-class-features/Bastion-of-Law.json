As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.7hAcETWHOVguR2ZF]{Sorcery Points} to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward lasts until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong> or until you use this feature again.</p><p>The ward is represented by a number of <strong>d8s</strong> equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-xBQg5BNgRcfx7DRZ\"><p><em>Note: After adding this feature to your character, set Resource Consumption to Item Uses: Font of Magic to have it deduct sorcery points.</em></p><p><em>You can either change this feature to deduct more points before rolling, deduct points manually, or roll this feature once per point spent.</em></p></section>",
