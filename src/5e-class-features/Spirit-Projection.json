      "value": "<p>At 14th level, your spirit can become untethered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is <strong>unconscious </strong>and in a state of suspended animation.</p>\n<p>Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your <strong>concentration </strong>is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice).</p>\n<p>While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your spirit and body gain <strong>resistance </strong>to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n<li>When you cast a spell of the <strong>conjuration </strong>or <strong>necromancy school</strong>, the spell doesn’t require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.</li>\n<li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were <strong>difficult terrain</strong>, but you take [[/r 1d10]] force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you are using your @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.e1orFuja4KP25lol]{Form of Dread}, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong>.</p>",
