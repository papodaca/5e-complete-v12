Arcane Archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.wgrHNslLKT8KpizM]{Banneret}</p><p>A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.bMVK3NFmtPS0gC8X]{Battle Master}</p><p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations.

Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.xujmMuByXQSax8cD]{Eldritch Knight}</p><p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight⁠⁠ combines the martial mastery common⁠ to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical Techniques similar to those practiced by wizards.
