As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is <strong>turned </strong>for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take <strong>reactions</strong>. For its action, it can use only the <strong>Dash </strong>action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the <strong>Dodge </strong>action.</p>\n<p>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>",
