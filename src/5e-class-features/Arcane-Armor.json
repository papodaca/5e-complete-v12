      "value": "<p>Beginning at 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.O1YQD4dGJgYz8PWD]{Smith's Tools} in hand.</p>\n<p>You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>\n<li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>\n<li>The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.</li>\n<li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.</p>",
