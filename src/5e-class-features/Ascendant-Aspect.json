      "value": "<p>At 17th level, your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Augment Breath.</strong> When you use your @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.fe0BTjxrqgY7jaJI]{Breath of the Dragon}, you can spend 1 @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.imsZ2GYUPlwCQqqy]{ki point} to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>\n<li><strong>Blindsight.</strong> You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>\n<li><strong>Explosive Fury.</strong> When you activate your @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.NEkjw1MSk5tTRgif]{Aspect of the Wyrm}, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: For the various effects...</em></p>\n<p><em>Augment Breath's extra damage is already built in to </em>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.fe0BTjxrqgY7jaJI]{Breath of the Dragon}<em>, it's only disabled.
