      "value": "<p>At 9th level, when a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to generate it.</p><p>You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.</p><p>You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>While a soul trinket is on your person, you have <strong>advantage</strong> on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.</p></li><li><p>When you deal @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.ZNG4a61hajMEzhb1]{Sneak Attack} damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.rRNsNqe3X7IPZiXZ]{Wails from the Grave}, without expending a use of that feature.</p></li><li><p>As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM.</p></li></ul>",
