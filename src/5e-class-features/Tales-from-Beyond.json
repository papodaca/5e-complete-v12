While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a <strong>bonus action</strong> to expend one use of your @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.7Q7X8BnKOsk2SXSt]{Bardic Inspiration} and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You can use an <strong>action </strong>to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.</p>\n<p>You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.</p>\n<p>If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details><details>\n<summary style=\"padding-bottom:8px\"><strong>Spirit Tales Table</strong></summary>\n<blockquote style=\"font-style:normal\">\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:6.51378%\">Die</td>\n<td style=\"width:93.4862%\">Tale Told Through You</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:6.51378%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:93.4862%\"><strong>Tale of the Clever Animal.</strong> For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die's number to the check.
