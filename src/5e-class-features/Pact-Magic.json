The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><table border=\"0\"><thead><tr><td>Level</td><td>Cantrips Known</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>Spell Slots</td><td>Slot Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
