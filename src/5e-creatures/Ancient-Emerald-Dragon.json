        "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Emerald dragons are the most curious, cunning, and manipulative of the gem dragons, wielding psionic power to weave illusions to deceive and disorient. They cloak their own presence so they can observe other creatures without being discovered as they collect information on everything from local cultural practices to supernatural occurrences.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"869\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shimmering Green</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A wyrmling emerald dragon's scales are a dull, pale green, but they develop into richer and more varied shades of green as the dragon ages. Eventually, the scales become translucent and shimmer in the light, rippling as the dragon moves. The dragon's horns and spines hover above the body, moving and shifting along the back and tail to mirror the dragon's mood.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"870\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Clever Concealment</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The shyest of the gem dragons, emerald dragons are also the most curious. They love to observe local settlements and peoples, using their psionic abilities to cloak themselves and watch from afar. When an emerald dragon is old enough, the dragon might take on the guise of a creature that can blend in with the local population, or at least get close without arousing suspicion. Once in a position to observe, the dragon studies the day-to-day life of local folk, with a keen interest in any magical phenomena.</p><p>Emerald dragons' attentiveness to unusual events makes them particularly useful to their sapphire dragon cousins, who hunt down Aberrations and seek evidence of Far Realm incursions into the Material Plane. These gem dragons often work together, with emerald dragons tracking the source of an incursion while sapphire dragons plan and execute a decisive purge—or recruit agents to do it for them.</p><p>Emerald dragons' preference for volcanic lairs often puts them in conflict with fire giants. Despite their reluctance to reveal themselves to strangers, emerald dragons might approach experienced adventurers in the hopes of pitting them against fire giant rivals.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"871\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarded Histories</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Emerald dragons prize knowledge, particularly local histories that focus on magical events and individuals. They usually know of places of power near their lairs and keep detailed records of how phenomena connected to those sites react to outside influences. They also avidly collect magic items and spells that create illusions, allowing them to better conceal their treasures from prying eyes and divinations.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"872\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">An Emerald Dragon's Lair</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Emerald dragons dwell in enormous caverns, lava tubes, and tunnel networks deep within the earth. They favor warm spaces, particularly in volcanic regions. Over time, their psychic presence seeps into the land surrounding their lairs, expanding their awareness and subconsciously luring their favorite food—giant lizards—to settle and thrive in the region.</p><p>Emerald dragons use the features of their lairs to confuse and imperil intruders. They dig additional tunnels that allow them to move through their lairs in multiple ways and set traps leading to yawning chasms or pools and flows of lava.</p><p>Emerald dragons take great pains to hide the chambers that house their hoards and collected lore, often using illusion magic and subtle construction around the natural features of their lairs to conceal their central hoard chambers from mundane and magical sight.</p><p>The challenge rating of a legendary emerald dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"873\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Beguiling Whisper.</span> The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature @condition[charmed] in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Distort Perceptions.</span> The dragon attempts to alter the perceptions of one creature it can see within its lair. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 ([[/r 4d10]]) psychic damage and have disadvantage on saving throws until the start of its next turn.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Vanish.</span> The dragon becomes @condition[invisible] until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"874\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Regional Effects</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>The region surrounding a legendary emerald dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Crystal Profusion.</span> Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and veins of emerald gemstones.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Fiery Sight.</span> Fire and lava within 6 miles of the lair become conduits for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the @spell[clairvoyance] spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any area of fire or lava in that region.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Subtle Obstruction.</span> Rocks within 6 miles of the dragon's lair sometimes move of their own accord, usually when no one is watching. Often the rocks obstruct the approach to the emerald dragon's lair, with boulders moving to block narrow defiles, way-markers tumbling off the path, or smaller stones shifting beneath travelers' feet to send them tumbling down slopes or into rivers.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Thriving Wildlife.</span> @creature[Giant lizard||Giant lizards] are attracted to the area within 6 miles of the lair and settle there in large numbers.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, the population of giant lizards near the lair returns to normal levels over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days. Rocks immediately stop moving of their own accord. The existing abundance of crystals and emeralds remains, but new ones form at a normal rate.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"865\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"866\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span></span> <p>Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"867\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skills.</span></span> <p>Most dragons are proficient in the <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"perception_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Perception</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"stealth_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Stealth</span> skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"868\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Traits and Actions.</span></span> <p>You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Change Shape.</span> You can decide that a dragon acquires this action at a younger age than usual, particularly if you want to feature a dragon in Humanoid form in your campaign:<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</span><span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Flyby.</span> The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Mimicry.</span> Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC <span class=\"rd__dc\">20</span> Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"insight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Insight</span>) check.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Rejuvenation.</span> You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in [[/r 1d10]] days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Special Senses.</span> Most dragons have <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"blindsight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">blindsight</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"darkvision_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">darkvision</span>. You might upgrade <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"blindsight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">blindsight</span> to <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"truesight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">truesight</span>, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"MM\" data-vet-hash=\"tremorsense_mm\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">tremorsense</span>.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Tunneler.</span> The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a tunnel in its wake.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div>",

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p></div>",
