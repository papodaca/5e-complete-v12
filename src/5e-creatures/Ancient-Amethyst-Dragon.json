        "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Amethyst dragons, the mightiest of the gem dragons, study and psionically manipulate the fundamental principles of the multiverse, from the force of gravity to the emanations of the Outer Planes. Their innate psionics give them a measure of control over how physical laws affect them. They defy gravity with flight that doesn't rely solely upon their great wings, and gravitational force empowers both their devastating breath weapon and the exploding amethyst crystals they spit at their foes.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"809\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Royal Purple</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>When first hatched, an amethyst dragon has scales of dull, opaque purple. As the dragon grows, their scales, horns, and wing membranes become more vibrant and translucent. When the dragon is fully mature, their scales resemble rich purple amethyst crystals, refracting light to take on an inner glow. Their pupils fade with age, making the eyes of an ancient dragon resemble glowing white or pale lavender orbs. Crystalline horns reminiscent of amethyst chunks hover behind their heads, held there by telekinetic force and shifting with their moods.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"810\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cosmological Study</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Many amethyst dragons are fascinated by the existence of other worlds in the Material Plane, and especially the way individual dragons manifest unique echoes across those worlds. They also prize understanding of the cosmic forces that emanate from the Outer Planes, studying the opposing tides of good and evil, chaos and order, so they can offer counsel to those with the wisdom to accept it.</p><p>Amethyst dragons pay particular attention to intrusions of the Far Realm into the Material Plane. They loathe the corruption that accompanies such intrusions into the world, making them fierce opponents of the Far Realm and any creatures warped by its touch. Strangely, though, they are intrigued by and fond of flumphs. These Aberrations, which oppose the depredations of mind flayers and other wicked Aberrations, remind amethyst dragons that allies can be found in the strangest places.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"811\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarded Arcana</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In addition to material wealth, amethyst dragons delight in collecting knowledge and magic dealing with the nature of the planes of existence, cosmic forces, and distant worlds. They prize treasures drawn from different worlds of the Material Plane, especially magic items and artworks that highlight the unique nature of different worlds. Magic items that allow teleportation or travel between planes, spellbooks filled with similar magic, and treatises examining the nature of the multiverse form the centerpiece of an amethyst dragon's hoard.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"812\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">An Amethyst Dragon's Lair</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Amethyst dragons make their lairs in caves next to or under secluded pools and lakes, preferring caverns with at least one entrance submerged underwater. They prize locations with a combination of open space, connecting tunnels, and dead ends to make the most of their natural and magical mobility, using flight and teleportation to navigate obstacles in their lairs.</p><p>The challenge rating of a legendary amethyst dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"813\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Beguiling Whisper.</span> The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature @condition[charmed] in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Imprisoning Force.</span> The dragon casts the @spell[forcecage] spell, using its spell save DC and requiring no spell components. The spell ends early if the dragon uses this lair action again or dies.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Spatial Projection.</span> The dragon chooses a space it can fit into within the lair. It exists in its own space and the chosen space simultaneously until initiative count 20 on the next round. Whenever it moves or takes an action, it chooses which version of itself is moving or acting. If an effect or attack can target both of the dragon's spaces at the same time, the dragon is affected only once.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"814\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Regional Effects</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>The region surrounding a legendary amethyst dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Background Check.</span> Once per day, the dragon can cast the @spell[legend lore] spell, requiring no spell components, naming any person, place, or object within 1 mile of the lair as the spell's subject.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Crystal Profusion.</span> Amethyst crystals and geodes form along muddy shores and lake beds within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Thriving Wildlife.</span> Fish and other aquatic Beasts reproduce rapidly and thrive in bodies of water within 6 miles of the lair. Foraging in these waters yields twice the usual amount of food.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Watery Sight.</span> Water within 6 miles of the lair is a conduit for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the @spell[clairvoyance] spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any body of water in that region.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, the populations of aquatic life near the lair return to normal levels over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days. The existing abundance of amethysts remains, but new crystals and geodes form at a normal rate.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"805\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"806\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span></span> <p>Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"807\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skills.</span></span> <p>Most dragons are proficient in the <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"perception_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Perception</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"stealth_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Stealth</span> skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"808\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Traits and Actions.</span></span> <p>You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Change Shape.</span> You can decide that a dragon acquires this action at a younger age than usual, particularly if you want to feature a dragon in Humanoid form in your campaign:<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</span><span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Flyby.</span> The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Mimicry.</span> Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC <span class=\"rd__dc\">14</span> Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"insight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Insight</span>) check.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Rejuvenation.</span> You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in [[/r 1d10]] days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Special Senses.</span> Most dragons have <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"blindsight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">blindsight</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"darkvision_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">darkvision</span>.
