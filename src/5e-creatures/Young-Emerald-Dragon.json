        "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Emerald dragons are the most curious, cunning, and manipulative of the gem dragons, wielding psionic power to weave illusions to deceive and disorient. They cloak their own presence so they can observe other creatures without being discovered as they collect information on everything from local cultural practices to supernatural occurrences.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1226\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shimmering Green</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A wyrmling emerald dragon's scales are a dull, pale green, but they develop into richer and more varied shades of green as the dragon ages. Eventually, the scales become translucent and shimmer in the light, rippling as the dragon moves. The dragon's horns and spines hover above the body, moving and shifting along the back and tail to mirror the dragon's mood.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1227\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Clever Concealment</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The shyest of the gem dragons, emerald dragons are also the most curious. They love to observe local settlements and peoples, using their psionic abilities to cloak themselves and watch from afar. When an emerald dragon is old enough, the dragon might take on the guise of a creature that can blend in with the local population, or at least get close without arousing suspicion. Once in a position to observe, the dragon studies the day-to-day life of local folk, with a keen interest in any magical phenomena.</p><p>Emerald dragons' attentiveness to unusual events makes them particularly useful to their sapphire dragon cousins, who hunt down Aberrations and seek evidence of Far Realm incursions into the Material Plane. These gem dragons often work together, with emerald dragons tracking the source of an incursion while sapphire dragons plan and execute a decisive purge—or recruit agents to do it for them.</p><p>Emerald dragons' preference for volcanic lairs often puts them in conflict with fire giants. Despite their reluctance to reveal themselves to strangers, emerald dragons might approach experienced adventurers in the hopes of pitting them against fire giant rivals.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1228\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarded Histories</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Emerald dragons prize knowledge, particularly local histories that focus on magical events and individuals. They usually know of places of power near their lairs and keep detailed records of how phenomena connected to those sites react to outside influences. They also avidly collect magic items and spells that create illusions, allowing them to better conceal their treasures from prying eyes and divinations.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1229\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating an Emerald Dragon</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Use the Emerald Dragon Personality Traits and Emerald Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive emerald dragon characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1230\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Emerald Dragon Personality Traits</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d8]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">I repeat what others have said back to them to make sure I have remembered it correctly.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\">I might not like you, but I will endeavor to treat you with respect, if not kindness.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\">I like to impress visitors by reciting epic poetry.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\">The only people I'm interested in are those who know history and those who make history.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"col-10\">I like to adopt the personas of characters from legend.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"col-10\">I studiously mimic the mannerisms of my guests.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"col-10\">I prefer to get others talking, then fade into the background.

It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</span><span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Flyby.</span> The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Mimicry.</span> Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices.

A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in [[/r 1d10]] days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again.

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p></div>",

It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p><p>If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p><p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (@skill[Investigation]) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p></div>",
