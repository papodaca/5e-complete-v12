        "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons. Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals. The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"891\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Luminous Blue</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sapphire dragons' scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice. In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts. The dragons' psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies. Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live. These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons' moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"892\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Art of War</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The warlike sapphire dragons devise strategies and ambushes based on their ability to maneuver underground. A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.</p><p>Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm. They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin's knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm. Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.</p><p>People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon's territory. But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"893\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Martial Hoards</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sapphire dragons' favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion. The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon's hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"894\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Sapphire Dragon's Lair</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sapphire dragons make their homes in extensive cave systems. As they grow older, they make increasingly complex renovations to their lairs, using their inherent magic and natural tunneling abilities to great effect. Eventually, a sapphire dragon's lair is a dizzying honeycomb of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow the dragon to travel from one end to the other unseen by intruders. The most secure lairs might feature no accessible entrances or exits at all, with the dragon relying on tunneling or shaping stone to come and go.</p><p>The challenge rating of a legendary sapphire dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"895\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Awesome Thunder.</span> A thunderous detonation of sound that can be heard up to 300 feet away surrounds one creature in the lair that the dragon can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 13 ([[/r 3d8]]) thunder damage and be @condition[stunned] until the end of its next turn.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Beguiling Whisper.</span> The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature @condition[charmed] in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Stone Passage.</span> The dragon touches a section of stone up to 30 feet in any dimension. The dragon can shape the stone to open or close a passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 10 feet thick.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"896\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Regional Effects</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>The region surrounding a legendary sapphire dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Crystal Profusion.</span> Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and veins of sapphire gemstones, particularly underground.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Stony Sight.</span> Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair is a conduit for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the @spell[clairvoyance] spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any natural stone formation in that region.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Telepathic Enhancement.</span> The dragon's psionic energy enhances the mental powers of other creatures. Any creature capable of telepathic communication has its telepathy range doubled while within 1 mile of the lair. This includes creatures with innate telepathy and magical telepathy such as the @spell[Rary's telepathic bond] spell.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Thriving Wildlife.</span> @creature[Giant spider||Giant spiders] (a sapphire dragon's favorite prey) are attracted to the area within 6 miles of the lair and settle there in large numbers.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, the population of giant spiders in the region returns to normal levels over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days. The enhancement of telepathic abilities ends immediately. The existing abundance of crystals and sapphires remains, but new ones form at a normal rate.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"887\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"888\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span></span> <p>Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"889\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skills.</span></span> <p>Most dragons are proficient in the <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"perception_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Perception</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"stealth_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Stealth</span> skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"890\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Traits and Actions.</span></span> <p>You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Change Shape.</span> You can decide that a dragon acquires this action at a younger age than usual, particularly if you want to feature a dragon in Humanoid form in your campaign:<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</span><span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Flyby.</span> The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Mimicry.</span> Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC <span class=\"rd__dc\">13</span> Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"skill\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"insight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">Insight</span>) check.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Rejuvenation.</span> You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.<span class=\"rd__p-cont-indent\">If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in [[/r 1d10]] days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</span></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Special Senses.</span> Most dragons have <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"blindsight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">blindsight</span> and <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"darkvision_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">darkvision</span>. You might upgrade <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"blindsight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">blindsight</span> to <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"truesight_phb\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">truesight</span>, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-vet-page=\"sense\" data-vet-source=\"MM\" data-vet-hash=\"tremorsense_mm\" data-vet-is-faux-page=\"true\">tremorsense</span>.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Tunneler.</span> The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a tunnel in its wake.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"902\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">On Target.</span></span> <p>You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"903\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Off Target.</span></span> <p>You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is [[/r 1d10 * 1d10]] (1d10 × 1d10) percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two [[/r d10]]s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a [[/r d8]] and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"904\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Similar Area.</span></span> <p>You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"905\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mishap.</span></span> <p>The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes [[/r 3d10]] force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div>",
