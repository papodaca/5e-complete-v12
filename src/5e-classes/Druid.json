They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><h2>Power of Nature</h2><p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others server gods of a wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><h2>Preserve the Balance</h2><p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world — air, earth, fire, and water — must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilizes folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p><h2>Sacred Plants and Wood</h2><p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><h2>Druids and the Gods</h2><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\">appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose druid as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a druid.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If druid isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a druid: light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal).</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster. Add all of your druid class levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
