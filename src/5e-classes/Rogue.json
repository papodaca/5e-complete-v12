She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><h2>Skill and Precision</h2><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><h2>A Shady Living</h2><p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats — and wererats — haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose rogue as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Dexterity score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a rogue.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If rogue isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a rogue: light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> If you take the Arcane Trickster subclass you are a third caster. Add one-third your levels (rounded down) in the rogue class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
