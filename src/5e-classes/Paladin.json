Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><h2>The Cause of Righteousness</h2><p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p><h2>Beyond the Mundane Life</h2><p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose paladin as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a paladin.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If paladin isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a paladin: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a half caster. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
