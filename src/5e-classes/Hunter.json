Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding this hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><h2>Terrors of the Wild</h2><p>Warriors of the wilderness, hunters specialize in tracking and slaying the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization - humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Hunters focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored prey.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, hunters acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p><h2>Independent Adventurers</h2><p>Though a hunter might make a living as a guide or a tracker, a hunter's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, hunters gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many hunters, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that — when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks — a ranger might be the first-and possibly the last-line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes hunters well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, hunters respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose hunter as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a hunter.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If hunter isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a hunter: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a half caster. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the hunter class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
