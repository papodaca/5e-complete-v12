Cleric</h1><p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p><p>Changing a song of glory, a dwarf sings his ace in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as a light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distance planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><h2>Healers and Warriors</h2><p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that powers, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p><h2>Divine Agents</h2><p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshippers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose cleric as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a cleric.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If cleric isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a cleric: light armor, medium armor, shields.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> You are a full caster. Add all of your cleric class levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
