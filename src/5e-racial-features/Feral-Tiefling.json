      "value": "<p>Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Appearance.</strong> Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4 + 1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goat-like legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.</p>\n<p><strong>Feral.</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.</p>\n<p>Choose one feature from the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Devil's Tongue.</strong> You know the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.Oj5Fl5Z6wrqJ7n9y]{Vicious Mockery} cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.TU1rTIejvenLb2tG]{Charm Person} spell once as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.Df6zcJlQT6mSZqwU]{Enthrall} spell once. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. This trait <strong>replaces</strong> the Infernal Legacy trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Hellfire.</strong> Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.IIuDZLMheyrdIkDW]{Burning Hands} spell once as a 2nd-level spell. This trait <strong>replaces</strong> the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.c72JpOcEfXcCNaH8]{Hellish Rebuke} spell of the Infernal Legacy trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Winged.</strong> You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulders. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. This trait <strong>replaces</strong> the Infernal Legacy trait.</li>\n</ul>",
