      "value": "<p>Yuan-ti were originally humans who transformed themselves into serpent folk through ancient rituals. Most yuan-ti were corrupted into monsters by those rites, but some yuan-ti instead became a new people who mix characteristics of humans and snakes.</p>\n<p>Blessed with resistance to magical and poisonous effects by the rituals that created them, each of these yuan-ti manifests their serpentine heritage in a variety of ways: a forked tongue, snake eyes, a snakelike nose, or some other ophidian characteristic. However a yuan-ti looks, they have the power to pursue great good or evil in the multiverse.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Type</strong>.
