      "value": "<p>Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves.</p>\n<p>Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. Their hair can resemble seaweed, waving as if in a current, or it can be like water itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Acid Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to acid damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Call to the Wave.</strong> You know the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.4vTsj0WebAOBYoAG]{Acid Splash} cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.PbQvcZ70QhVM8dOy]{Create or Destroy Water} spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ZawX9Na89BZTw0OM]{Water Walk} spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast Create or Destroy Water or Water Walk with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: Create two copies of </em>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.PbQvcZ70QhVM8dOy]{Create or Destroy Water}<em> and </em>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ZawX9Na89BZTw0OM]{Water Walk}<em> on your character.
