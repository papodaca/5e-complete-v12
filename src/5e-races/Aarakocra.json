      "value": "<p>A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa — mighty beings of air — and were imbued with a measure of their masters' power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power.</p>\n<p>From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies — usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Ability Score Increase.</span></strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong> </strong>Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature</strong><strong> Type. </strong>You are a Humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Size. </strong>Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Flight.</strong> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Talons.</strong> You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Wind Caller.</strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn]{Gust of Wind} spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or highter.</p>\n<p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you case <em>Gust of Wind</em> with this trait (choose when you select this race).</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: Use the </em>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-racial-features.AAWJmRgHFsk3E5lW]{Talons}<em> feature for your unarmed strikes.</em></p>\n<p><em>Create two copies of </em>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.NJoboox7UplFADzn]{Gust of Wind} <em>on your character.
