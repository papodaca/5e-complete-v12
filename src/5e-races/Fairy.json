      "value": "<p>The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.</p>\n<p>Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You're also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:170px\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:100%\" colspan=\"2\">Fey Characteristics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">d8</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">Characteristic</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">Your wings are like those of a bird</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">You have shimmering, multicolored skin.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">You have exceptionally large ears.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">A glittering mist constantly surrounds you.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">You have a small spectral horn on your forehead, like a little unicorn horn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">Your legs are insectile.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">You smell like fresh brownies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:10.2564%;height:17px\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:89.7436%;height:17px\">A noticeable, harmless chill surrounds you.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one ability score by 2, and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Fey.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Span.</strong> Fairies have a life span of about a century.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Fairy Magic.</strong> You know the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.OvnQ67velre55gqO]{Druidcraft} cantrip.
