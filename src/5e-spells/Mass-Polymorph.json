      "value": "<p>You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling <strong>shapechanger</strong> automatically succeeds on the save.</p><p>Each target assumes a <strong>beast</strong> form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the targets (or half the targets level, if the target doesnt have a challenge rating). The targets game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.</p><p>Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points cant be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.</p><p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It cant speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech. The targets gear melds into the new form.</p><p>The target cant activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard</p>",
