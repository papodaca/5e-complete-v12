On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.</p><p>At the end of each of the targets turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the diseases effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.</p><p>Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a diseases effects apply to it.</p><h3>Blinding Sickness</h3><p>Pain grips the creatures mind, and its eyes turn milky white.
