The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.</p><p>For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with <strong>darkvision</strong> can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is <strong>immune</strong> to thunder damage, and creatures are <strong>deafened</strong> while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p><p>Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [[/r 8d10]] force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is <strong>disintegrated</strong>. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.7iH4qANs2gxn0MIs.JournalEntryPage.5YX3k6END6NQWHOB]{Wizard}</p></div>",
