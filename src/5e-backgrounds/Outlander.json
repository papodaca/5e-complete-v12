      "value": "<p>You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Athletics, Survival</p>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>One type of musical instrument</p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>One of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.Pv3zNvREHzP9HxXX]{Staff}, a @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.gE89xaR36KxLyKxS]{Hunting Trap}, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-items.PCuoUWnUkXE21PAh]{Traveler's Clothes}}, and a pouch containing 10gp</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-background-features.SdVkZNSPZDvZjQde]{Origin}</p>\n<p>You've been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-background-features.RDCARuFjnjBFYFhM]{Wanderer}</p>\n<p>You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>\n<p>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5%\">d8</td>\n<td style=\"width:95%\">Personality Trait</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:95%\">I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:95%\">I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:95%\">I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn my clan of an approaching orc horde.
